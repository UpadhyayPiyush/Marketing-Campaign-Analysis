# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

## Project Background
The marketing agency involved in this analysis aims to maximize ROI for its clients' ad campaigns. In 2019, two separate advertising campaigns were conducted on Facebook and AdWords. This analysis was undertaken to determine which platform delivers better results in terms of key performance indicators, including ad clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By uncovering these insights, the agency can better allocate its budget and optimize future marketing strategies for its clients.
